# A game demo "Dark Slay" with Java GUI

? Not sure if it will be rendered by react-markdown

## How to run it?
Run main method in src/DarkSlay.java;
No dependency required. All code built with native JRE.;

## I want to try it out immediate.
Download DarkSlayJava.jar and Make sure you have Java installed on your computer. 
Double click it.

## What's the game basically?
So far it is still a copy of the game 'Slay the Spire' https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Slay_the_Spire_Wiki
Slay the Spire is among the best-selling indie games, which refer to a category of games that are developed with minimum amount of staff, investment, and without a proper marketing. 
Our plan is to develop a game influenced by the Slay the Spire. 
The core gameplay is remained: move around rooms and play cards to fight with monsters.
Key is two extra characters:
1. An online multiplayer mechanics. Allow human players play against each other. 
2. Souls-like gameplay. In a few words: hard, player dies a lot, dark-fantasy, and checkpoints in maze. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulslike 

## So it appears to be not good enough.
The program is only a trial. We built the basic logic of the game.
Mainly did Object Oriented design. 
No art assets used yet.
Future development will be done with LibGDX, which is a Java game dev kit used to build Slay the Spire. 

## What's on the way?
